"""Stage 1 — calibration. Sentinel pass, rasterise, semantic pass, crop escalation.

Phase 1 of docs/04-BUILD-PLAN.md; specification in docs/02-SPEC.md §1.

The semantic pass runs one vision call per rendered page. Any field that comes back
with `confidence: low` or no `printedLabel` is escalated: we re-render a crop around
each of the field's widget rectangles, extended ~120pt to the left and ~40pt
vertically so the printed caption is in frame, and re-query in small batches. A null
`itemNumber` alone never escalates — many forms number nothing. A field that still
resolves to nothing lands in `unresolved` — a first-class output, not an error.

STATUS NOTE (2026-07-27): the escalation path has never completed end to end — both
DL 142 runs that exercised it timed out, and after the predicate fix neither DL 142
nor Form 56 fired it. Treat it as untested; SS-4 or 8821 will exercise it first.
